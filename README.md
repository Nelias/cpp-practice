C++ programs written to practice this language

## Running a program

### Linux

1. In your terminal window from the root folder go to a program's folder `cd folder-name`
2. Run `clang++ program-name.cpp`
3. Run `./a.out`

### Windows

1. Install MinGW
2. Use the `gcc` compiler or `g++` in a program like `Code::Blocks`, `Visual Studio` or `CLion` to create the `.exe` file.

## Tips

Do not use `<conio.h>` because it is non-standard and it is non-portable.
